#### WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Modularization of my code
Simplifying functions
DRY 

2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Pacing myself to code regularly while having sufficient rest.

3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
Course material should be updated.
The first could be have a faster pace.
More material could have been prepared so we could code along better.

Instructor was very accommodating and went very in depth. Enjoyed the lessons.
