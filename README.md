### Concept

**Motivations**

This game will
*	strengthen my understanding of dom and js
*	help me develop a routine when approaching a project
- git commit often
- applying Agile Workflow
*	reinforce all the concepts learnt from class
*	deepen my understanding of scope
*	be a gauge of my current understanding

**Technical Requirements**

The game needs to:
* **Display a game in the browser**
* be interactive
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation** that is triggered by a **browser event**

**Required Deliverables**

* A **non-broken game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Design
- have header to show game name
- have an display which will render the game it can be displayed in the middle
- have a side bar for additional infomation
- have a bar below the display for the user input
- have a section for the how to instructions

Overall layout shld look like a game console or arcade machine. Color palette might follow retro theme.
